## Installation

First of all, i recommend to make an [Virtual Environtment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#:~:text=A%20virtual%20environment%20is%20created,the%20virtual%20environment%20are%20available.) to run this project. Althought it still can run without it.

```bash
  python.exe -m venv <your venv name> #change value inside <>
```

After you successfully make the [Virtual Environtment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#:~:text=A%20virtual%20environment%20is%20created,the%20virtual%20environment%20are%20available.), run the script to activate the venv.

Type this command in your current Terminal in VS Code.

```bash
  <your venv name>/Scripts/activate #change value inside <>
```

And finally, run the streamlit using

```bash
  streamlit run Home.py
```
